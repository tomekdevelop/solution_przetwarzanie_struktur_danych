Hello, hello, hello
(This is a rock song.)
Loud, loud, loud
It's a junkie dream, makes you so uptight
Yeah it's halloween tonight and every night
See you scratch your skin
Your sandpaper throat
You're a symphony, man, with one fucking note
Charlie beat you up week after week
And when you grow up you're going to be a freak
Want a violent girl who's not scared of anything
Help me kill my time
'Cause I'll never be fine
Help me kill my time
